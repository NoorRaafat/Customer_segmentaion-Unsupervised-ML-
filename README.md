## :pushpin: Credit Card Customer Segmentation
<br>
This project aims to segment credit card customers based on their spending behavior and preferences. By clustering customers into distinct groups, financial institutions can gain insights into customer segments, tailor marketing strategies, and optimize product offerings.

### üìù Dataset
<br>
The dataset used in this project contains information about credit card holders, including their balance, purchase behavior, credit limit, and payment history.<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/sadkoktaybicici/credit-card-data-clustering-k-mean/data">Here</a>.


### üß† Analysis Overview
<br>
The analysis is divided into the following steps:

#### 1-Data Preprocessing:

-Addressed issues such as null values, outliers, and skewed distributions.
-Applied log transformation to handle skewness in the data.
-Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of each feature.

#### 2-Clustering Algorithms:

-Explored multiple clustering algorithms including K-means, Hierarchical Clustering, Gaussian Mixture Models, and DBSCAN.
-Utilized TSNE visualization to visualize clustering results in 2D space.
-Leveraged techniques such as Elbow Method and PCA to determine the optimal number of clusters.

#### 3-Interpretation of Clusters:

-Provided insightful interpretations of each cluster based on customer behavior and purchase patterns.
-Identified distinct clusters with unique spending habits and preferences.

#### 4-Training and Hyperparameter Tuning:

-Explored different linkage criteria and distance functions for Hierarchical Clustering.
-Utilized Dendograms to visualize cluster hierarchies and determine the optimal number of clusters.

#### 5-Improvement Ideas:

-Proposed several improvement ideas, including the use of PCA for dimensionality reduction, trying different transformation techniques, and implementing gap statistics method for evaluation.


### ‚ô£Ô∏è Usage
<br>

#### 1-Environment Setup:

-Ensure Python and necessary libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy, scikit-learn) are installed.
-Download the dataset from the provided link and place it in the project directory.

#### 2-Data Preprocessing:

-Run the preprocessing script to clean the dataset and handle missing values, outliers, and skewness.

 #### 3-Clustering Analysis:

-Execute the clustering scripts to apply various clustering algorithms and determine customer segments.
-Visualize clustering results using TSNE plots, dendrograms, and other visualization techniques.

#### 4-Interpretation and Insights:

-Analyze the clusters and extract insights into customer behavior and preferences.
-Document findings and recommendations for business stakeholders.

#### ü§ù Conclusion
Credit card customer segmentation is essential for understanding customer needs, optimizing marketing strategies, and improving customer satisfaction. By leveraging clustering techniques, financial institutions can gain actionable insights into customer segments and drive business growth.
